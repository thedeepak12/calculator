# Calculator

This project is a simple, interactive web-based calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator features a clean, modern user interface with a responsive design. It includes error handling for invalid inputs and division by zero, ensuring a robust user experience.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
- **Error Handling**: Displays "Error" for invalid expressions, division by zero, or incorrect input formats.
- **Clear Functionality**: Includes an "AC" button to reset the display.
- **Interactive UI**: Buttons provide visual feedback with hover and active states, enhancing usability.
- **Decimal Support**: Allows decimal numbers for precise calculations.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5**: Structures the calculator's layout and user interface.
- **CSS3**: Styles the calculator with a modern, sleek design using HSL color schemes and flexbox for layout.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the calculator's logic, including expression parsing, operator precedence, and error handling.

## What I Learned

- **Expression Parsing**: Gained experience in parsing mathematical expressions and implementing operator precedence using a stack-based approach.
- **JavaScript Error Handling**: Learned to use try-catch blocks to handle runtime errors gracefully, such as division by zero or invalid inputs.
- **Responsive Design**: Improved skills in CSS flexbox and media queries to create a user-friendly interface.
- **Event-Driven Programming**: Enhanced understanding of DOM manipulation and event listeners to create an interactive UI.
- **Code Organization**: Practiced structuring JavaScript code for readability and maintainability, separating concerns like display updates and calculation logic.
